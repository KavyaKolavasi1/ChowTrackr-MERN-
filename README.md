# ChowTrackr (Full Stack MERN App)

## What is ChowTrackr?

### ChowTrackr is a website created to store all information food related! 

#### Shared Family Recipes:
As a family, we often share many of our recipes. With ChowTrackr there is no more of a need to ask how something was made! By storing all of the recipes in a shared space, we can pass this priceless data for generations to come.

Technologies Used: MERN - MongoDB (Database), Express (Backend), React (Frontend), Node.js (Backend)

#### Food Ordering:
With ChowTrackr, having all of the information in one place allows all members to quickly input their order's (however complicated they may be) into the Order Trackr. A designated user can then input all of the orders into the delivery app of their choice and update payment and delivery information.
There is no more need to create separate text chains or pass around a phone to relay information multiple times!

Technologies Used: React/JavaScript, Node.js

## What was the inspiration?
We would on many occasions order lunch during office hours for > 7 people. More than often, this would cause disruption to the workflow as it would take much time to gather all orders and create group chats to relay redundant information multiple times. It was always a burden and no one wanted to be designated with the task of inputting and gathering all the orders. With ChowTrackr, the time and efficiency of this process has dramatically improved!
